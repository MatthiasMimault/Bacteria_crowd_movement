# BacteryModel

Matlab code. 2D finite volume model with nonlocal interaction

Features: Zero flux Neumann boundary, source boundary, attraction (eikonal equation), attraction (neighbourhood), diffusion,
vector field timer switch, log generator

To run
Go to Exec and run the desired run script (for instance run_V32_0428_EasyRun)
You can modify its parameters in section 0 (Domain, density, interaction strenght, diffusion, time and discretisation)

To plot
Go to Exec and run the desired plot script (for instance run_V10_0428_EasyRun)
You can choose a type of output (fig or png) and a scale of density (min-max)
